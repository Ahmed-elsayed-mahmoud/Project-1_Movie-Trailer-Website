# Project Files

There are three main python files:

  - **main.py** - This is the main file which will call the function that generates the website and pass the movies list as a parameter.
  - **fresh_tomatoes.py** - The provided web page generator. It takes in a list of movies and builds the `HTML` and opens up
  your default browser to display the generated `HTML` page.
  - **media_movie.py** - This class provides a way to store movie related information such as the movie's title, storyline, poster image url and youtube trailer
    so it can be accessed by fresh_tomatoes.py to construct a website of movie trailers.
